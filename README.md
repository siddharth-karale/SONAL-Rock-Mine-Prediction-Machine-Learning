# SONAR-Rock-Mine-Prediction-Machine-Learning

Prediction Rock Vs Mine from data using Machine Learning technique.

A Machine Learning based project that using the Logistic Regression algorithm to predict, from a sub-marine using sonar, whether an object in the sea is a rock or a mine set out by the enemies. Sonar is a device that uses sound waves to detect objects.

## Technologies Used:

  * Python
  * Pandas
  * NumPy
  * Scikit-learn
    
## Dataset:

The UCI Machine Learning Repository Sonar dataset consists of 208 sonar measurements of rocks and mines.

## Methodology:

* Importing the Libraries
* Data Collection and Data Processing (Loading the Dataset, Basic Statistics of the Data, Checking for Null Values,Counts of Unique Values in the '60' Column)
* Splitting the Data (Train-Test Split)
* Model Training: Logistic Regression
* Model Evaluation (Accuracy on Training Data, Accuracy on Test Data)
* Making Predictions ( Prediction for Input Data 1, Prediction for Input Data 2)

## Results:

Achieved an accuracy of 83.33%, demonstrating the model's ability to effectively distinguish rocks from mines.

## Project Structure:

The project is organized as follows:

* Data: This directory contains the Sonar dataset in CSV format.
* Notebooks: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks with the Python code used for data analysis and visualization.
* README.md: This file provides an overview of the project, objectives, and instructions for running the code.
